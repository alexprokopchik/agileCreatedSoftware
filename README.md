# agileCreatedSoftware
Software that was created for a client based on their interviews, and using the skill of communicating with that client in a simple and non-technical manner. This information then had to be delivered successfully to a group of technical developers in a more complex and technical manner. The software allows the user to login, and based on their login credentials give them certain permissions to be able to access/edit files based on where they stand in the hierarchy of the design. This program was achieved with a team of 4 using the agile method. (Java, MYSQL)
